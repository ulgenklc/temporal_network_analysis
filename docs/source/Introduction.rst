Installation/Usage
*********************
As the package has not been published on PyPi yet, it CANNOT be installed using ``pip``.

For now, the suggested method is to put the file ``Temporal_Community_Detection.py`` in the same directory as your source files and call:

.. code-block:: python

    from Temporal_Community_Detection import temporal_network


    
If you additionally play with synthetically generated data, refer to the ``helpers.py`` file and call:

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import *
