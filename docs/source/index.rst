Welcome to Community Characterization in Temporal Networks's documentation!
===========================================================================
Community Characterization in Temporal Networks is our python wrap-up for applying dynamic community detection on temporal networks obtained from spike-train data. We generate spiking neuronal activity with varying community events and compare the performances of 5 different community detection algorithms: MMM, Infomap, Tensor Factorization, DSBM and DPPM where DPPM is not included in this package since it is available in MATLAB.
