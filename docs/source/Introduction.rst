Installation/Usage
*********************
As the package has not been published on PyPi yet, it CANNOT be installed using ``pip``.

For now, the suggested method is to put the file `Temporal_Community_Detection.py` in the same directory as your source files and call ``from Temporal_Community_Detection import temporal_network``.
