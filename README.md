# Temporal Networks
Temporal network is a python package for multilayer network analysis of time series data via dynamic community detection (DCD).

We present our skeleton coupling algorithm within the package accompanied by the paper:
Bengier Ãœlgen Kilic, Sarah Feldt Muldoon, Skeleton coupling: a novel interlayer mapping of community evolution in temporal networks, 2023,https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10860

## Available DCD algorithms
Additionally, one can perform several different community detection algorithms such as:

Multilayer Modularity Maximization(MMM) (PJ. Mucha et al. 2010) using a Louvain-like greedy algorithm Leiden (VA. Traag et al. 2019).
